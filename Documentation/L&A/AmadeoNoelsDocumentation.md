Currently, I have already worked on 2 projects. In 1 project there we already used a programmed C#. With holes in it here and there that we had to fix by using tests that were pre-written. On the other side we used html combined with css and javascript to make sure we got a nice result on the client side. The other project I worked on was a project with a springboat backend combined with vue boostrap frontend. To day I have never been in contact with micro controllers, on-board computers.
Right now, my view on IOT systems is that they are used for simplifying our lives and thereby making our lives a lot more pleasant by being able to give us advice on problems that may arise. For example, like a smart refrigerator that can opzichtly make an order for refilling the milk.
I expect to learn a lot of new things from the classes, because I haven't done anything with Internet of Things until now. So I am very curious about everything we will cover in this block. I am looking forward to learning about what happens behind when we use IOT systems in our daily lives.

Today I came across all kinds of attributes for creating different types of smart devices. I am lucky to be in a group with people like Josh, Luthando and Kyle, who I can go to and ask all my questions I had about all these new attributes.

What does the Internet of Things entail? A simple Internet of Things definition is that it is a huge worldwide network of connected objects. These 'things' are embedded with sensors, processors and software to collect and share data about the way they are used and about the environment around them. An Internet of Things platform integrates data from the different devices and applies analytics to share the most valuable information with applications built to address specific needs. https://www.nanowerk.com/smart/internet-of-things-explained.php

Domains:
Industrial - IIoT monitors the quality of any product at each stage, from procurement to the final delivery. Moreover, it corrects and prevents risks in the product lifecycle.

Medical - tracking how many patients are in a hospital, receiving the correct medicine for a patient, and monitoring their health at a distance, also known as Telemedicine

Building and House Automation - users can manage wireless instruments from anywhere.

Protocols:
The benefit and value of IoT comes from enabling the components to communicate. This communication happens via IoT protocols, which ensure that data sent from endpoint devices, such as sensors, is received and understood by the next and subsequent steps in the connected environment, whether the next step for that data is to another endpoint device or a gateway or an application.

AMQP Short for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol, AMQP is an open standard protocol used for more message-oriented middleware.

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that uses short-wavelength, ultrahigh-frequency radio waves.

Cellular provides high bandwidth and reliable communication. It's capable of sending high quantities of data, which is an important capability for many IoT deployments.

Typical Devices:
Home Security - The key driver behind smart and secure homes is IoT. A variety of sensors, lights, alarms and cameras (all of which can be controlled from a smartphone) are connected via IoT to provide 24x7 security.

Activity Trackers - Smart home security cameras provide alerts and peace of mind. Activity trackers are sensor devices that can monitor and transmit key health indicators in real-time. You can track and manage your blood pressure, appetite, physical movement and oxygen levels.

Benefits of IoT: Better use of resources and assets Cost-effective operation Improved work safety Efficiency and productivity Improved experience

Challenges IoT: Security flaws Power supply dependence Network dependence Associated costs

ESP8266
Why esp8266? Has changed his live. You can easily program this network and attach LEDs sensors etc. to it. Everything is affordable. It’s the bridge from software to hardware.


What is personally inspiring for you? It makes it possible for everyone to create new things, no matter how much money you have.


What is the connection to coffee? Espresso Light was the first version – changed how we design and build things because it’s so cheap. It’s the same price as the price of a coffee.

Today we split into 2 groups to work on creating our first web server that provides a connection between a button that is pressed and causes a light to turn on or off on the other side.
For me, everything was new so everything we learned today is a totally new experience that I gained. For me personally, it was often not clear what we were expected to present now

Today I got to work on the basics of Node-Red. I started by sending simple messages to a debug. Later, I created several lines that depending on the wildcard were either going to display the message or not. Finally, I went to work on creating my own dashboard, simulating a kind of air conditioner. Depending on the temperature, it would either switch on or not.

Today was a difficult day, our teacher had prepared something for the whole class that we were going to install together. Unfortunately, this did not work out and a lot of time passed before class could resume. Today we mainly focused on implementing a Discord bot which actually went very well for us. We found a very good tutorial on youtube that easily guided us through the whole process.

Today I set to work creating a touch sensor. This was quite easy thanks to a good tutorial found on Ulrich Norbisrath's youtube channel.

Today we started introducing ourselves to the teacher. Then we got to work on making a small presentation to introduce our project to the teacher https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AB9427Mz43Jxqp1JAkuUrCHxulFLlcXiawb3ESTPtyg/edit#slide=id.gc6f9e470d_0_0. In the meantime, I installed ubuntu on my laptop that we would need later in the day. I started by following the powerpoint offered to us for installing and qtcreator. Unfortunately, I had installed the wrong version of Ubuntu which prevented me from completing the full slides.

What we did today was creating an mqqtbrokerwebserver application involves installing a web server, MQTT library, writing the code for the application, testing it, and deploying it to a production environment. Once deployed, users will be able to access the mqqtbrokerwebserver application through a web browser and use it to connect to an MQTT broker, publish and subscribe to topics, and view the data.

What we did today in class: replacing the mosquitto MQTT broker on the Raspberry Pi with the Snode.C-based mqttbroker application involves installing the necessary libraries, downloading and running the mqttbroker application, configuring it to your liking, and testing it with the mosquitto_sub/pub tasks. Once everything is working as expected, you can stop the mosquitto MQTT broker and set the mqttbroker application to start automatically when the Raspberry Pi boots.

Today in class we were creating a root CA, end certificate, and using these certificates to secure the communication between an MQTT broker and the mosquitto_sub/pub task involves generating and installing private keys and signed certificates on the root CA, MQTT broker, and mosquitto_sub/pub task, and configuring each entity to trust the root CA's certificate. This ensures that the MQTT broker and the mosquitto_sub/pub task can securely identify each other and communicate over a secure connection.

Today in class we connected a server and client using certificates involves generating and installing private keys and signed certificates on both the server and client, and configuring each side to trust the other's certificate. This ensures that the server and client can securely identify each other and communicate over a secure connection.
