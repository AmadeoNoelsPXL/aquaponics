Currently, I have already worked on 2 projects. In 1 project there we already used a programmed C#. With holes in it here and there that we had to fix by using tests that were pre-written. On the other side we used html combined with css and javascript to make sure we got a nice result on the client side. The other project I worked on was a project with a springboat backend combined with vue boostrap frontend. To day I have never been in contact with micro controllers, on-board computers.
Right now, my view on IOT systems is that they are used for simplifying our lives and thereby making our lives a lot more pleasant by being able to give us advice on problems that may arise. For example, like a smart refrigerator that can opzichtly make an order for refilling the milk.
I expect to learn a lot of new things from the classes, because I haven't done anything with Internet of Things until now. So I am very curious about everything we will cover in this block. I am looking forward to learning about what happens behind when we use IOT systems in our daily lives.

Today I came across all kinds of attributes for creating different types of smart devices. I am lucky to be in a group with people like Josh, started with a K and ended with an e, Luthando, who I can go to and ask all my questions I had about all these new attributes.

Today we split into 2 groups to work on creating our first web server that provides a connection between a button that is pressed and causes a light to turn on or off on the other side.
For me, everything was new so everything we learned today is a totally new experience that I gained. For me personally, it was often not clear what we were expected to present now

Vandaag was een moeilijke dag, onze leerkracht had voor de hele klas iets voorbereid wat we samen gingen installeren. Helaas lukte dit niet en is er heel wat tijd overheen gegaan vooraleer de les terug hervat kon worden. Vandaag hebben we ons vooral bezig gehouden met het implementeren van een discord bot wat ons eigenlijk zeer goed afging. We vonden op youtube een zeer goede tutorial die ons makkelijk doorheen het hele proces leidde.

Today I set to work creating a touch sensor. This was quite easy thanks to a good tutorial found on Ulrich Norbisrath's youtube channel.
