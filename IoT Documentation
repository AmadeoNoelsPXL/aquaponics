2022/11/07 - connected to wifi gateway on raspberri pi using iotgateway img
Today we created a wifi hotspot using a rasberry pi. 
Hilariously, we did this by using a keyboard. Problems we encountered today was the fact that we forgot to download etcher to flash the SD card.
Furthermore, we had problems flashing the card. We could not initially get it working possibly because the SD card reader was broken. 
We solved this by using another SD card reader which allowed us to connect to our own created network.
